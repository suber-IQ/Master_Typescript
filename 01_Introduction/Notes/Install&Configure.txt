✴️To install and configure TypeScript, follow these steps:

1️⃣Install Node.js: TypeScript requires Node.js to be installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: 🔗https://nodejs.org.

2️⃣Install TypeScript: Once Node.js is installed, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

🌟npm install -g typescript

👉 This will install the latest version of TypeScript on your machine.


3️⃣Create a TypeScript file: Create a new file with the extension .ts and add some TypeScript code, for example:


🌟function greet(name: string) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("TypeScript");



4️⃣Compile the TypeScript file: To compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript, run the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

🌟tsc filename.ts


👉 This will create a new file with the extension .js that contains the compiled JavaScript code.

5️⃣Run the JavaScript file: You can now run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

🌟node filename.js

👉 This will output the message "Hello, TypeScript!" to the console.
You can also configure the TypeScript compiler using a tsconfig.json file, which allows you to specify compiler options and other settings. For more information on configuring TypeScript, refer to the official TypeScript documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/.
