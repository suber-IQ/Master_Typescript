1️⃣TypeScript and JavaScript are interoperable, which means that they can work together seamlessly in the same codebase. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

2️⃣TypeScript code can also use existing JavaScript code or libraries, without requiring any modification or conversion. This allows developers to gradually migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript by incrementally adding types and other TypeScript features to their codebase.

3️⃣On the other hand, JavaScript code can consume TypeScript code using TypeScript declaration files. Declaration files provide type information for TypeScript code, which can be used by JavaScript code to ensure that the TypeScript code is being used correctly.

4️⃣In addition, TypeScript provides a "any" type, which allows developers to use existing JavaScript code without type annotations. This is useful when working with third-party libraries that do not have TypeScript definitions.

5️⃣Overall, the interoperability between TypeScript and JavaScript allows developers to take advantage of the benefits of both languages in the same codebase. This enables them to improve the maintainability and scalability of their applications, while also leveraging existing JavaScript code and libraries.
