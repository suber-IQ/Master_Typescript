✴️TypeScript and JavaScript are both programming languages, but they have some differences in their syntax and features.


1️⃣Static Typing: TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that variables and function parameters have to be declared with a specific type. This helps catch errors at compile-time, making code more robust and maintainable. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed language, which means that types are inferred at runtime.

2️⃣Optional Types: TypeScript also has support for optional types, which allows developers to specify that a variable or parameter may be of a certain type, but doesn't have to be. This is useful for cases where you may not know the type of a variable until runtime.

3️⃣Classes and Interfaces: TypeScript has a more robust support for classes and interfaces, which are used to define object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs. JavaScript also supports OOP, but its syntax is more limited.

4️⃣Compiler: TypeScript requires a compiler to transpile the code into JavaScript, which can then be run in a browser or on a server. JavaScript does not require a compiler, as it is a scripting language that can be executed directly in a browser or server.

5️⃣Tooling: TypeScript has excellent tooling support, with features like code completion, code navigation, and refactoring available in many integrated development environments (IDEs). JavaScript also has good tooling support, but it's not as advanced as TypeScript.
